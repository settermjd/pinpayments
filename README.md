===========

This is a simple example of how to interact with the [Pin Payments API](https://pin.net.au/docs/guides/request-payments) in PHP using [Guzzle 4](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle). 

Whilst not perfect, and arguably really rudimentary, it still helps out with understanding how to interact with the API. If you need any further information, email me ([matthew@maltblue.com](matthew@maltblue.com)) or tweet me ([@settermjd](https://twitter.com/settermjd)).
